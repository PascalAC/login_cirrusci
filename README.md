# CirrusCI on a simple Login screen

[![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/PascalAC/login_cirrusci.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/PascalAC/login_cirrusci)

This contains a simple login form with two TextFields to input an Email and a Password and a Login button. There is also a simple validator attached which checks if the entered email contains a '@' sign and that the password is at least 4 characters long.  

The test file is to check the behavior of the CI.
